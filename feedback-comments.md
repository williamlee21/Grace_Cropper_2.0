## Github-related stuff

- Nice commit messages! Make sure to standardize your git commit message format, like maybe [this one](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
- Daniela: [set your local git email config properly](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)
- Reference closed issues in PR (documentation)
- Having someone review a PR (not the person who made it)
